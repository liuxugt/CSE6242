Visualization:
Histogram of zip codes. Once we hover on the bar, we need to display the population division based on ethnicity.
Cusine heatmap
cusine vs restaurant
rating vs restaurant location
rating vs attributes (box plots)


Testing Model:
Take few restaurants as a test data set. We will calculate average per cuisine for each zip code.
Once we have a prediction, we will check if our predicted zip code has an average cuisine (for that particular cuisine) rating of
greater than 3.
